            <pre>
         Let’s say you’re a first-time entrepreneur who’s looking to sell digital products 
         or services. Maybe you’re a designer, engineer, coder, or writer. 
         And you’re launching your first online course. 

         How would you market your product/service? How do you successfully 
         capture the interest and curiosity of your target audience?

         Some people decide to leave all their marketing needs to professional marketers. 
         And depending on your circumstances, that could work for you too. 
         But in my experience, whether you’ll hire a marketer or not, it’s in your best interest to
         have a good understanding of effective copywriting.

         In other words, you want to know how to offer your product in a way that more 
         prospects are willing to buy. You want to increase your conversion rate.

         You know your product/service best. And you understand the value of what you’re 
         offering better than anyone else. If you combine that knowledge with the copywriting strategy 
         you’ll learn in this article, you’ll have an edge over your competitors and potentially sell more.

         So let’s take a look at one of the foundations of selling anything: Benefits and Features. 

         If you learn about this principle, you’ll know more about copywriting and marketing 
         than 99% of the population. Benefits and features are often used interchangeably and confused with one another. 
         But they’re different.

         To illustrate, we’ll take a look at the Waking Up app by Sam Harris. 
         It’s the best mindfulness and meditation app I’ve used so far. I think the app’s website 
         and social media channels are great at selling the app. Let’s look at why that is. 
         But first, let’s define them. 
         <h2>What are features?</h2>
         Features describe what your product/service does and how it’s different from the competition. 
         Go to your local car dealer and they’ll sell you their car’s features: electronic stability control, 
         the latest video and sound system, special tether functions for drivers who have small kids, and so forth.

         If you’re a website designer; the features of your service can include website speed optimization,
         unique mobile-friendly site designs, etc. You get the idea.
         
         The Waking Up App has features that aren’t available in other meditation and 
         mindfulness apps, and this makes it stand out in the market:

         -Different types of meditation available: metta-loving, headless, meditation for children, etc.
         -Conversations with meditation experts about various life topics
         -In-depth talks about the fundamentals of mindfulness and meditation A timer with a zen gong
         <h2>What are benefits? </h2>
         Features talk about what the product/service does. Meanwhile, benefits 
         focus on how the product/service can be helpful to the target audience. This is basically 
         why people purchase things/services—because it’s helpful to them.

         That’s also why most ads you see are benefit-focused. Take a look at this Waking Up ad:
         
         <a  target="_blank" href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/alkY2bhWFlHx8l4tKdkVge2howDUAhTkv87TAV5oAU50nJahjqYdz_upMVd-3gwMUzIPRjS69UbV9CJQGwfIJxQo-5DBpnaSHEorJHLTUNw6iAN6w3KO_wU9vbs8iw1SyE6DYShG=s0">Waking Up Add</a>

         Notice the ad doesn’t talk about features. Instead, it focuses on the app’s main 
         benefit: “understanding the mind for the purpose of living a better life.”

         We purchase something because we have an unmet need. And benefit-focused 
         messaging shows how your product/service can fulfill that unmet need. 
         They talk about the results or outcomes your target audience aims to achieve.

         As Zig Ziglar, author of Secrets of Closing the Sale said: “Stop selling. Start helping.”
         <h2>The Key Difference</h2>
         When customers decide to buy (or not buy), they consider both benefits and 
         features. They think about things like price, relevance, design, and so forth. 
         But ultimately, customers buy because of a product’s benefit.

         Once the customer is sold on the concept (they’re convinced a meditation app 
         can help them live a better life), they’ll start looking at options. They ask, 
         “Which meditation app is the best for me?”

         That’s where features come in. It signals which audience is the best fit. And 
         since we’re bombarded with options every day, features help our product/service to stand out.
